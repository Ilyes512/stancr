# WIP

This project is still a Work in Progress. Checkout [Ilyes512/boilr](https://github.com/ilyes512/boilr) if you need a tool right now.

# Note

This project is inspired by [tmrts/boilr](https://github.com/tmrts/boilr). I first forked the project [Ilyes512/boilr](https://github.com/Ilyes512/boilr), but decided to create a new project to get some more hands-on experience with Golang.
